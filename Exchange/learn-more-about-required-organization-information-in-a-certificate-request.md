# Learn more about required organization information in a certificate request

When you create a new certificate request (also known as a certificate signing request or CSR) for a certification authority (CA), these X.500 values are included in the certificate's **Subject** field. Although a value is required in every field before you can proceed, the CA might not care about certain fields (for example, **Department name**), while other fields are very important (for example, **Country/Region name** and **Organization name**). Check the **Subject** field requirements of your CA.
