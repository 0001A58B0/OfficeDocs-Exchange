A hybrid deployment offers organizations the ability to extend the feature-rich experience and administrative control of their existing on-premises Microsoft Exchange organization to the cloud. Providing the seamless look and feel of a single Exchange organization between an on-premises Exchange organization and Exchange Online in Office 365, a hybrid deployment can also serve as an intermediate step to moving completely to an Exchange Online organization.
The Hybrid Configuration Wizard provides you with a streamlined process to configure a hybrid deployment between your on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online organizations.
  
    
    


> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are several important considerations and prerequisites that you need to complete before you use the Hybrid Configuration wizard. You must meet the requirements for hybrid deployments outlined in  [Hybrid Deployment Prerequisites](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/e7454db0-fed4-4662-8890-9501126b1ba2.aspx). Then you'll be ready to use the Hybrid Configuration wizard to configure your Exchange organization for the hybrid deployment.
