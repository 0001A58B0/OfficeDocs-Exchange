> This feature of Exchange 2016 isn't fully compatible with Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China and some feature limitations may apply. For more information, see  [Learn about Office 365 operated by 21Vianet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=313640). 
  
    
    

On the **Receiving Client Access servers** page, select one or more servers in your on-premises organization that have the Client Access server role installed. The selection of multi-role servers is also supported. A multi-role server is a server that has both the Mailbox and Client Access server roles installed.
The on-premises Client Access servers you select here will be configured with Receive connectors by the Hybrid Configuration wizard to accept secure mail from the Microsoft Exchange Online Protection service in your Office 365 tenant.
