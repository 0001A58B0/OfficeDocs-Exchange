# Learn more about running a per-mailbox litigation hold report

If your organization is involved in a legal action, you may have to take steps to preserve relevant data, such as email messages, that may be used as evidence. In situations like this, you can use litigation hold to retain all email sent and received by specific people or retain all email sent and received in your organization for a specific time period. Use the per-mailbox litigation hold report to keep track of the following types of changes made to a mailbox in a given time period:
  
    
    


- Litigation hold was enabled.
    
  
- Litigation hold was disabled.
    
  

For each of these change types, the report includes the user who made the change and the time and date the change was made. For more information about what happens when a mailbox is on litigation hold and how to enable and disable it, see the **Mailbox Features** section in [Manage User Mailboxes](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/957ca61c-1fa1-42ab-a0e6-8488e4782566.aspx).
