# Exchange 2016 Setup - Hybrid Deployment Check

On the **Hybrid Deployment Check** page, Setup checks to see if your Microsoft Office 365 organization is ready for Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 to be installed in your on-premises organization.
  
    
    

If you've configured a hybrid deployment between your on-premises organization and Office 365, the following requirements must be met before you can install Exchange 2016:
- The Office 365 organization must be upgraded to the latest version of the service.
    
  
- All users in the Office 365 organization must be upgraded to the latest version of the service.
    
  
Until all the requirements above have been met, you can't install Exchange 2016.For more information about hybrid deployments, see  [Exchange Server 2016 Preview Hybrid Deployments](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/59e32000-4fcf-417f-a491-f1d8f9aeef9b.aspx). For more information about what's required before installing Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 in an organization with an existing hybrid deployment with Office 365, see  [Hybrid Configuration Wizard Prerequisites](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/e7454db0-fed4-4662-8890-9501126b1ba2.aspx).Having problems?
