# Learn more about exporting mailbox audit logs

When mailbox auditing is enabled for a mailbox, Microsoft Exchange logs information in the mailbox audit log whenever a user other than the owner accesses the mailbox. Each log entry includes information about who accessed the mailbox and when, the actions performed by the non-owner, and whether the action was successful. Entries in the mailbox audit log are retained for 90 days by default. You can use the mailbox audit log to determine if a user other than the owner has accessed a mailbox.
  
    
    

When you export entries from mailbox audit logs, Microsoft Exchange saves the entries in an XML file and attaches it to an email message sent to the specified recipients within 24 hours.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You have to enable mailbox audit logging on each mailbox that you want to audit before you can export and view mailbox audit logs.
