# Learn more about role group members

A role group member is a mailbox, universal security group (USG), or other role group that can be added as a member of a role group. When a mailbox, USG, or another role group is added as a member of a role group, the assignments that have been made between management roles and a role group are applied to the new member. This grants the new member all the permissions provided by the management roles. For more information about role groups, see  [Understanding Management Role Groups](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/2a92e06c-523e-4fd4-a937-152562b7741d.aspx).
