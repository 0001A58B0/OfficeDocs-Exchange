Importing a certificate on an Exchange server installs the certificate on the server. After you install the certificate, you can use it for encryption tasks in Exchange. For more information, see  [Import or install a certificate on an Exchange 2016 server](import-or-install-a-certificate-on-an-exchange-2016-server.md).
