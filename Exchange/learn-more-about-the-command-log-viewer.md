# Learn more about the command log viewer

The command log viewer records the Shell commands that you run in the Exchange admin center. This allows you to see the commands that the EAC is running and lets you create your own Shell commands starting with the commands in the viewer. You can copy the command by high-lighting the text and pressing CTRL+C on your keyboard.
  
    
    

For full detailed and syntax information for the commands, see  [Exchange 2013 cmdlets](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/c05a8c55-fbb3-4eb6-ad02-ea5430f03132.aspx).
