# Learn more about UM auto attendant business hours

Unified Messaging (UM) enables you to create UM auto attendants for your organization. You aren't required to create UM auto attendants, but they can help internal and external callers locate users or departments and transfer calls to them.
  
    
    


## Non-business and business hours custom greetings
<a name="nonandbusinesshours"> </a>

After you create a UM auto attendant, a default system prompt will be used for the non-business hours main menu prompt greeting that callers hear after the non-business hours welcome greeting is played. Frequently, in addition to configuring a customized non-business hours welcome greeting, you also want to create and configure a custom non-business hours main menu prompt greeting. After you configure a custom non-business hours main menu prompt greeting, you must enable key mappings on the UM auto attendant for non-business hours. 
  
    
    
A custom non-business hours main menu prompt greeting is a list of options callers hear during non-business hours. For example, "You have reached Trey Research after normal business hours. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, please hang up and dial 911. To leave a message for one of our doctors, press 1. To leave a message for one of our physical therapists, press 2. To leave a general message for one of our front office coordinators, press 3. To be connected with an after-hours operator, press 0."
  
    
    
By default, when you create a UM auto attendant, the business and non-business hours greetings or prompts aren't configured and no key mappings are defined for business or non-business hours main menu prompts. Although you can't replace or change the system prompts, you will probably want to customize the greetings and menu prompts. To correctly configure customized main menu greetings and prompts, you must:
  
    
    

1. Configure business and non-business hours using **Configure business hours**. 
    
  
2. Create a greeting file that will be used for the non-business hours welcome greeting.
    
  
3. Create a greeting file that will be used for the business hours welcome greeting.
    
  
4. Create a greeting file that will be used for the non-business hours main menu prompt greeting.
    
  
5. Create a greeting file that will be used for the business hours main menu prompt greeting.
    
  
6. Add the greeting file that will be used for the business hours main menu prompt greeting using **Menu Navigation** > **Business hours menu navigation** > **Menu prompt** > **Browse**.
    
  
7. Enable business hours menu navigation and add your new menu navigation including the prompts, keys, and actions. 
    
  
8. Add the greeting file that will be used for the non-business hours main menu prompt greeting using **Menu Navigation** > **Non-business hours menu navigation** > **Menu prompt** > **Change**.
    
  
9. Enable non-business hours menu navigation and add your new menu navigation including the prompts, keys, and actions.
