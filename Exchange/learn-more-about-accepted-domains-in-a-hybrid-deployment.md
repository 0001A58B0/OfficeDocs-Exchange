# Learn more about accepted domains in a hybrid deployment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature of Exchange 2016 isn't fully compatible with Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China and some feature limitations may apply. For more information, see  [Learn about Office 365 operated by 21Vianet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=313640). 
  
    
    

Before configuring a hybrid deployment with the Hybrid Configuration wizard, you must add at least one on-premises accepted domain to your Office 365 tenant organization. You'll also need to prove domain ownership of this domain by adding a TXT record to your public DNS.
The domain can be added either manually in the Office 365 tenant as part of the service configuration or using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).
