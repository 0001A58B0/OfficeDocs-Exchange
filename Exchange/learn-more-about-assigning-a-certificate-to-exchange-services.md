# Learn more about assigning a certificate to Exchange services

You need to assign a certificate to one or more Exchange services before the Exchange server is able to use the certificate for encryption. Once you assign a certificate to a service, you can't remove the assignment.
  
    
    

You don't need to replace the Microsoft Exchange self-signed certificate to encrypt SMTP traffic between Exchange servers and services in your organization. You need additional certificates to encrypt SMTP connections between Exchange servers and external messaging servers.
