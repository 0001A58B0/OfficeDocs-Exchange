Sharing policies provide user-established, people-to-people sharing of both calendar and contact information with different types of external users. Sharing polices allow your users to share both their free/busy and contact information (including the Calendar and Contacts folders) with recipients in other external federated Exchange organizations. For recipients that aren't in an external federated organization or are in non-Exchange organizations, sharing policies allow people-to-people sharing of their calendar information with anonymous users through the use of Internet Calendar Publishing.
