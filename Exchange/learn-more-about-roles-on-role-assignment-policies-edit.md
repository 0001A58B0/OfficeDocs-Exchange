# Learn more about roles on role assignment policies [Edit]

Management roles provide access to view or modify the configuration of Exchange 2013 components such as mailboxes, transport rules, and recipients. In addition to administrator roles, which are used to manage Exchange 2013 servers and recipients, Exchange 2013 includes several end-user roles. Each end-user role enables users to self-administer a specific portion of their mailbox or Outlook Web App. For example, an end-user role may grant users permissions to change their contact information. For more information about roles, see **Understanding Management Roles**.
  
    
    

End-user roles can be added or removed to or from management role assignment policies. Every mailbox is assigned one assignment policy. The roles added to assignment policies determine the complete set of options that users can self-administer on their mailbox or in Outlook Web App. To add a role on an assignment policy, select the role on the **Role Assignment Policy** page. If a role has child roles, the child roles are selected automatically.
For more information about assignment policies, see **Understanding Management Role Assignment Policies**.
