# Learn more about Receive connector network adapter binding

The network adapter bindings specify the IP addresses and port of the network adapter to bind to the receive connector. The connector listens for connections on the specified IP addresses on the local server.
  
    
    

If you have multiple network adapters on your local server, you can add an IP address that is assigned to a specific network adapter on the server.
