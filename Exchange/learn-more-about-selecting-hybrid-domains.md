> This feature of Exchange 2016 isn't fully compatible with Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China and some feature limitations may apply. For more information, see  [Learn about Office 365 operated by 21Vianet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=313640). 
  
    
    

On the **Hybrid domains** page, you can select one or more accepted domains in your on-premises organization that you want to configure for hybrid features. The domains you select will be configured for federated sharing between your on-premises Microsoft Exchange and Exchange Online organizations by the Hybrid Configuration wizard.
If you only have a single accepted domain in your on-premises organization, the domain is automatically selected by the Hybrid Configuration wizard and you can't remove the domain from the hybrid configuration process.
