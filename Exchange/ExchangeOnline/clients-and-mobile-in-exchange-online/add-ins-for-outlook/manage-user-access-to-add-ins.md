# Manage user access to add-ins for Outlook in Exchange Online

We recommend that you manage Office add-ins for your Exchange Online organization via Centralized Deployment in the Office 365 admin center. For more information, see [Manage deployment of Office 365 add-ins in the Office 365 admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/manage/manage-deployment-of-add-ins).
