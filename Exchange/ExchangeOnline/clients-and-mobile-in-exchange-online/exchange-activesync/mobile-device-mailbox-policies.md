# Mobile device mailbox policies in Exchange Online

In Office 365, you can create mobile device mailbox policies to apply a common set of policies or security settings to a collection of users. A default mobile device mailbox policy is created in every Office 365 organization. 
  
## Overview of mobile device mailbox policies

You can use mobile device mailbox policies to manage many different settings. These include the following: 
  
- Require a password
    
- Specify the minimum password length
    
- Allow a numeric PIN or require special characters in the password
    
- Designate how long a device can be inactive before requiring the user to re-enter a password
    
- Wipe a device after a specific number of failed password attempts
    
## Managing Exchange ActiveSync mailbox policies

Mobile device mailbox policies can be created in the Exchange admin center (EAC) or the Exchange Management Shell. If you create a policy in the EAC, you can configure only a subset of the available settings. You can configure the rest of the settings using the Exchange Management Shell. 
  
## Mobile device mailbox policy settings

The following table summarizes the settings you can specify using mobile device mailbox policies.
  
**Mobile device mailbox policy settings**

|**Setting**|**Description**|

|Allow Browser  <br/> |This setting specifies whether Pocket Internet Explorer is allowed on the mobile device. This setting doesn't affect third-party browsers installed on the mobile device. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Allow Camera  <br/> |This setting specifies whether the mobile device camera can be used. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Allow Consumer EMail  <br/> |This setting specifies whether the mobile device user can configure a personal email account (either POP3 or IMAP4) on the mobile device. The default value is  `$true`. This setting doesn't control access to email accounts that are using third-party mobile device email programs.  <br/> |
|Allow Desktop Sync  <br/> |This setting specifies whether the mobile device can synchronize with a computer through a cable, Bluetooth, or IrDA connection. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Allow External Device Management  <br/> |This setting specifies whether an external device management program is allowed to manage the mobile device.  <br/> |
|Allow HTML Email  <br/> |This setting specifies whether email synchronized to the mobile device can be in HTML format. If this setting is set to  `$false`, all email is converted to plain text.  <br/> |

|Allow non-provisionable devices  <br/> |This setting specifies whether mobile devices that may not support application of all policy settings are allowed to connect to Office 365 by using Exchange ActiveSync. Allowing non-provisionable mobile devices has security implications. For example, some non-provisionable devices may not be able to implement an organization's password requirements.  <br/> |
|Allow POPIMAPEmail  <br/> |This setting specifies whether the user can configure a POP3 or an IMAP4 email account on the mobile device. The default value is  `$true`. This setting doesn't control access by third-party email programs.  <br/> |
|Allow Remote Desktop  <br/> |This setting specifies whether the mobile device can initiate a remote desktop connection. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Allow simple password  <br/> |This setting enables or disables the ability to use a simple password such as 1111 or 1234. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Allow S/MIME encryption algorithm negotiation  <br/> |This setting specifies whether the messaging application on the mobile device can negotiate the encryption algorithm if a recipient's certificate doesn't support the specified encryption algorithm.  <br/> |
|Allow S/MIME software certificates  <br/> |This setting specifies whether S/MIME software certificates are allowed on the mobile device.  <br/> |
|Allow storage card  <br/> |This setting specifies whether the mobile device can access information that's stored on a storage card.  <br/> |
|Allow text messaging  <br/> |This setting specifies whether text messaging is allowed from the mobile device. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Allow unsigned applications  <br/> |This setting specifies whether unsigned applications can be installed on the mobile device. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Allow unsigned installation packages  <br/> |This setting specifies whether an unsigned installation package can be run on the mobile device. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Allow Wi-Fi  <br/> |This setting specifies whether wireless Internet access is allowed on the mobile device. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Alphanumeric password required  <br/> |This setting requires that a password contains numeric and non-numeric characters. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Approved Application List  <br/> |This setting stores a list of approved applications that can be run on the mobile device.  <br/> |
|Attachments enabled  <br/> |This setting enables attachments to be downloaded to the mobile device. The default value is  `$true`.  <br/> |
|Device encryption enabled  <br/> |This setting enables encryption on the mobile device. Not all mobile devices can enforce encryption. For more information, see the device and mobile operating system documentation.  <br/> |
|Device policy refresh interval  <br/> |This setting specifies how often the mobile device mailbox policy is sent from the server to the mobile device.  <br/> |
|IRM enabled  <br/> |This setting specifies whether Information Rights Management (IRM) is enabled on the mobile device.  <br/> |

|Password recovery enabled  <br/> |When this setting is enabled, the mobile device generates a recovery password that's sent to the server. If the user forgets their mobile device password, the recovery password can be used to unlock the mobile device and enable the user to create a new mobile device password.  <br/> |
