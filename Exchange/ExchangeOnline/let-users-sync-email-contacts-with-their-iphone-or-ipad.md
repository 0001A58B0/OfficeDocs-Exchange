## What is OWA for Devices contact sync?
<a name="__top"> </a>

OWA for Devices refers to the OWA for iPhone and OWA for iPad apps. With these apps, users can set up their mobile device to synchronize their Outlook Web App contacts with their mobile device's address book. 
  
Admins can use OWA for Devices contact sync to control whether users can sync their contacts. This feature is already turned on, allowing users to easily maintain their business contacts on several iOS devices. However, if you have privacy concerns and don't want the contact information for your organization shared to your users' mobile devices or any services they use for storing data, you can turn OWA for Devices contact sync off. 
  
When you turn OWA for Devices contact sync off, the contents of a user's Outlook Web App contacts folder won't be copied to their iOS device address book. Any contact information that was previously synchronized with the user's mobile devices is also removed. However, the user can change their device's privacy setting to not allow access to Outlook Web Access. In this case, the data cannot be altered or removed. After you turn OWA for Devices contact sync off, it can take up to eight hours for the change to take effect. 
  
OWA for Devices contact sync controls synchronization only for users who connect to their mailboxes by using the OWA for iPhone or OWA for iPad apps. If you have enabled Exchange ActiveSync in your organization, your users can still sync their contacts. Exchange ActiveSync is offered on many mobile devices and can provide different levels of security for your organization's data. For information about how to enable and disable Exchange ActiveSync, see [Manage how users use email and IM on their phones](https://support.office.com/article/270f95fb-6e8f-4813-a29d-57f83fbb7f2f).
