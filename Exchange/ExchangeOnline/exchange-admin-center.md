### List view

When you select a tab, in most cases you'll see a list view. The list view in Exchange admin center is designed to remove limitations that existed in Exchange Control Panel.
  
In Exchange Online, the viewable limit from within the Exchange admin center list view is approximately 10,000 objects. In addition, paging is included so you can page to the results. In the **Recipients** list view, you can also configure page size and export the data to a CSV file. 
  
### Details pane

When you select an item from the list view, information about that object is displayed in the details pane.
  
 **To bulk edit several items**: press the CTRL key, select the objects you want to bulk edit, and use the options in the details pane. 
  
### Centers, Me tile, and Help

The Centers tile allows you to change from one admin center to another. The Me tile allows you to sign out of the EAC and sign in as a different user. From the Help ![Help Icon](media/ITPro_EAC_HelpIcon.gif) drop-down menu, you can perform the following actions: 
  
- **Help** Click ![Help Icon](media/ITPro_EAC_HelpIcon.gif) to view the online help content.
