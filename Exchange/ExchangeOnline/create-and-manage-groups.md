# Create and manage groups in the new Exchange admin center

Use the new Exchange admin center (EAC) to create, modify, export or remove groups in your Exchange Online organization.

There are three types of groups that can be used to distribute messages:

- **Microsoft 365 group** (formerly known as Office 365 groups), is used for collaboration between teams, both inside and outside your company; by giving them a group email and a shared workspace for conversations, files, and calendars.

  >[!NOTE]
  > **Microsoft 365 group** is the recommended group as it provides the teams a shared workspace to communicate, share files, appointments, emails, contacts and other mailbox items.

- **Distribution list group** is used for sending emails/notifications to a group of people.

- **Mail-enabled security group** is used for granting access to resources such as OneDrive, SharePoint, and emailing notifications to those users.

For more information see, [groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/compare-groups?view=o365-worldwide).

See one of the following topics for managing groups in the new Exchange admin center:
