A federation trust is a relationship with the Microsoft Federation Gateway and your on-premises organization. The Microsoft Federation Gateway acts as the trust broker between your on-premises Exchange organization and other federated Exchange organizations. If you want to configure federated sharing in your Exchange organization, you must establish a one-time federation trust with the Microsoft Federation Gateway.
