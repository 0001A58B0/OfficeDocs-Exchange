# Learn more about renewing a certificate issued by a certification authority

To renew a certificate that was issued by a certification authority (CA), you need to create a certificate request (also known as a certificate signing request or CSR) that you send to the same CA that issued the certificate. The CA then sends you the actual certificate file that you need to install on the Exchange server. For more information, see  [Renew an Exchange 2016 certificate](renew-an-exchange-2016-certificate.md).
