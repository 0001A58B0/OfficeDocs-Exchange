# Exchange 2010 servers must be upgraded to SP3 RU11 or later [E16E14CoexistenceMinVersionRequirement]

Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Setup can't continue because it detected one or more Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 servers haven't been upgraded to Service Pack 3 (SP3) for Exchange Server 2010. Before you can install Exchange 2016, all Exchange 2010 servers in your organization must be upgraded to Exchange 2010 SP3 Update Rollup 11 (RU11) or later. This requirement includes Exchange 2010 Edge Transport servers.
  
    
    


> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you upgrade your Exchange 2010 Edge Transport servers to Exchange 2010 SP3 RU11, you must **re-create** the Edge subscription between your Exchange organization and each Edge Transport server to update their server version in Active Directory. For more information about re-creating Edge subscriptions in Exchange 2010, see [Managing Edge Subscriptions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=269724).
