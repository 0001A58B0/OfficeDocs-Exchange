# Learn more about the Policy Tip compliance URL

Policy Tips are informative notices that your users see in their Outlook 2013 client while they're composing a message. Policy Tips help users understand that they may be violating the business practices or policies that you're enforcing with your organization's DLP policies. You may want to provide a link to your organization's compliance policy for users, and that's what the **Compliance URL** field is for. Users can click the link that you provide, so make sure it points to a relevant web page.
  
    
    


## Tips for writing a compliance URL

Your compliance URL will only show up if you set up a DLP policy rule with an action that will cause your notification to appear. In other words, you can create a policy tip that isn't associated with any rules, so make sure that you add the **Notify the sender with a Policy Tip** action to your rule.

### URL restrictions

Your link needs to be in the http:// or https:// style. For example, http://example.com. Other types of URLs won't work.
