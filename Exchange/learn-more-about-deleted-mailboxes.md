# Learn more about deleted mailboxes

Administrators can delete Exchange Online mailboxes by using the **Remove-Mailbox** cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell or by deleting the corresponding user account in Office 365. If a mailbox is deleted in Exchange Online, the corresponding Office 365 user account is also deleted.
  
    
    

After a mailbox is deleted, it can be restored within 30 days. After 30 days, the mailbox and mailbox data will be non-recoverable. To restore a deleted mailbox, you have to restore the corresponding Office 365 user account. For more information, see  [Delete or restore users](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=279162).
