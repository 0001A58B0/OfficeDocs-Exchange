# Learn more about Send connector types

When you create a Send connector in the Exchange admin center E(AC), you're required to select a **Type** (usage type), which isn't required in the Exchange Management Shell. On Send connectors, the usage type is basically a descriptive label that identifies what the Send connector is used for, because all usage type values receive the same permissions. For a description of the available **Type** values, see [Send connector usage types](send-connectors.md#UsageTypes).
