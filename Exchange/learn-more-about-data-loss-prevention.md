# Learn more about data loss prevention

Data loss prevention (DLP) policies are packages that contain sets of conditions; which are made up of rules, actions, and exceptions that you create in the Exchange Administration Center (EAC) and then activate to filter email messages. DLP can help you enforce compliance requirements for data and manage its use in email. Microsoft has provided a wide range of policy templates to help you get started quickly. To learn more about configuring DLP policies, see  [DLP Procedures](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/e2f575aa-552e-4dcc-8d7b-1ffd697d67df.aspx). In addition to the customizable DLP policies themselves, you can also inform email senders that they may be about to violate one of your policiesâ€”even before they send an offending message. You can accomplish this by configuring Policy Tips. For more information, see  [Policy Tips](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/4266b83c-dd8a-4b3d-99ff-402e68fc810c.aspx).
