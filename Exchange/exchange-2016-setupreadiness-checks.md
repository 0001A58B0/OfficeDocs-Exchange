# Exchange 2016 Setup - Readiness Checks

On the **Readiness Checks** page, Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 checks to see if your organization and the computer you're running Setup on are ready for Exchange.
  
    
    

After Setup completes the readiness checks, it'll report any failures as errors. You'll need to fix any reported errors before you can install Exchange 2016. You don't need to exit Setup when resolving some readiness check errors. After resolving a reported error, click **retry** to run the readiness checks again. Be sure to also review any warnings that are reported. If all readiness checks have completed successfully, click **next** to install Exchange 2013.
> [!TIP]
> You can copy the results of the readiness checks to Notepad for easier viewing. To do so, select the text in the gray results list with your mouse and then press CTRL-C. Then, paste the text into Notepad.
