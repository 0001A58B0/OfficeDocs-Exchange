# Learn more about organizational units

Management role scopes enable you to define the specific scope of impact or influence of a management role when a management role assignment is created. When you apply a scope, the role assignee assigned to the role can only modify the objects contained within that scope. This can be helpful if you want members of the role group to manage only a certain set of users or resources. For more information about role scopes, see  [Understanding Management Role Scopes](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/24ed4a38-438a-4223-9f9c-5d4dea4b046b.aspx).
  
    
    

Organizational units (OUs) can be used to define a scope. When you apply an OU to a role group, the members of the role group will only be able to modify the objects contained within that OU. To specify an OU, use the format  _<domain>_/ _<OU>_. For example, contoso.com/users.
