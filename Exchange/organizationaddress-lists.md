# Organization > Address Lists

An address list is a collection of recipient and other Active Directory objects. Each address list can contain one or more types of objects (for example, users, contacts, groups, public folders, and room and equipment resources). You can use address lists to organize recipients and resources, making it easier to find the recipients and resources you want.
