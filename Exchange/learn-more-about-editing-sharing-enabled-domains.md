When you create a new federation trust, an organization identifier (OrgID) is automatically created with the Microsoft Federation Gateway. This OrgID is a combination of a predefined string and the first accepted domain that's selected for federation. For example, when editing sharing domains, if you specify the federated domain contoso.com as your organization's primary SMTP domain, theFYDIBOHF25SPDLT.contoso.com account namespace will be automatically created as the OrgID for the federation trust.
You can also add additional accepted domains from your on-premises Exchange organization to enable federated sharing with the user mailboxes in those domains.
