> This feature of Exchange 2016 isn't fully compatible with Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China and some feature limitations may apply. For more information, see  [Learn about Office 365 operated by 21Vianet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=313640). 
  
    
    

On the **Certificate** page, select a certificate for the hybrid deployment configuration. This certificate will be used to authenticate secure mail transport between your on-premises Microsoft Exchange and Exchange Online organizations.
The certificate you choose must be one purchased from a trusted third-party certificate authority (CA) and installed on your Exchange 2013 Mailbox and Client Access servers. Self-signed or any certificates generated by your organization as the CA aren't supported in hybrid mail transport.
