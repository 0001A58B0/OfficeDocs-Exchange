# Learn more about address lists

By default, Exchange creates address lists that contain all members of your organization. To create a custom address list, click **Add a rule** to create a filter. If you don't click **Add a rule**, you'll wind up creating an address list that's redundant with one of the existing default address lists. You can create multiple filters to further reduce the number of recipients that the address list applies to. Creating additional filters will make a Boolean **And** statement, and the more filters you add, the fewer users the address list will apply to. Be careful though -it's possible to add too many filtering statements and create an address list that doesn't apply to any users in your organization.
  
    
    

After you've finished creating the filter, click **Preview recipients the address lists includes** to verify that the address lists includes the recipients you want..
