# Learn more about exporting the administrator audit log

Administrator audit logging records specific actions performed by administrators and users who have been assigned administrative privileges. Any action that is based on an Exchange Management Shell cmdlet and doesn't begin with the verbs **Get**, **Search**, or **Test** is logged in theadministrator audit log. That means that whenever an administrator uses the Shell, the Exchange Administration Center (EAC), or Outlook Web App > Options to perform any action that creates, modifies, or deletes an object, the action is logged in the administrator audit log.
  
    
    

When you search for and export entries from the administrator audit log, Microsoft Exchange saves the search results in an XML file and then attaches it to an email message sent to the specified recipients.
