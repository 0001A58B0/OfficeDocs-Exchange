# Learn more about the master account for a linked mailbox

The linked master account is the external user account located in the trusted account forest. This master account will be associated with the new linked mailbox. When you create a linked mailbox, a disabled user account that corresponds to the linked mailbox is created in the Exchange forest. However, the external user signs in to their mailbox using the same credentials that they use to log on to the accounts domain.
