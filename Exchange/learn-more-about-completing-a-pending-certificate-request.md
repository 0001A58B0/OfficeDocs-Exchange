# Learn more about completing a pending certificate request

After you create a certificate request for a new certificate from a certification authority (CA) or to renew an existing certificate that was issued by CA, you send the contents of the request file to the CA. After you receive the new or renewed certificate from the CA, you need to install the certificate file or files on the Exchange server.
