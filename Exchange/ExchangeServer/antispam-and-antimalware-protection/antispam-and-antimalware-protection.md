# Antispam and antimalware protection in Exchange 2016

Overview of the built-in anti-spam and antimalware features available in Exchange 2016. 
  
Antispam and antimalware protection are included in Exchange Server 2016.
  
- Antispam protection is provided by the same built-in transport agents that were available in Exchange Server 2010. These agents are enabled by default on Edge Transport servers, and you can enable many of them on Exchange 2016 Mailbox servers.
    
- Antimalware protection is provided by the Malware agent that was introduced in Exchange Server 2013. The Malware agent is available and enabled by default on Exchange 2016 Mailbox servers.
    
The following table contains links to topics that provide overview information and configuration steps for customizing the built-in spam and malware filtering settings for your organization.
