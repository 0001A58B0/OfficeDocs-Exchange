# The local computer isn't joined to an Active Directory domain [ComputerNotPartofDomain]

Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Setup can't continue because it detected that the local computer isn't a member of an Active Directory domain. You must join the local computer to an Active Directory domain before you can install Exchange 2016. You may also see this message if you log into a local user account on the computer instead of a domain user account with sufficient administrative rights to install Exchange 2016.
  
For more information, see [Exchange 2016 system requirements](../../plan-and-deploy/system-requirements.md).
