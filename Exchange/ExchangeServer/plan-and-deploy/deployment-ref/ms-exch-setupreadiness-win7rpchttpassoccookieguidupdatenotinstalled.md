# KB2619234 update not installed [Win7RpcHttpAssocCookieGuidUpdateNotInstalled]

Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Setup can't continue because the local computer requires a software update. You'll need to install this update before Exchange 2016 Setup can continue.
  
Exchange 2016 Setup requires an update to Windows that allows Outlook Anywhere (formerly known as RPC over HTTP) to work correctly.
  
Download and install the 64-bit update from the following URL, and then click **retry** on the **Readiness Checks** page.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If this update requires a reboot to complete installation, you'll need to exit Exchange 2016 Setup, reboot, and then start Setup again.
  
Microsoft Knowledge Base article KB2619234, [ A hotfix is available to enable the Association Cookie/GUID that is used by RPC over HTTP to also be used at the RPC layer in Windows 7 and in Windows Server 2008 R2) ](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=3052&kbid=2619234)
