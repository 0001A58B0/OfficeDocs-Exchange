# AD LDS directory exists in default location [ADAMDataPathExists]

Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Setup can't continue because the attempt to install Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) failed.
  
An older installation of AD LDS exists in the default location. Setup can't perform a new AD LDS install in an existing AD LDS directory structure.
  
To resolve this issue, remove the existing AD LDS directory and then run Setup again.
  
For more information about AD LDS directory management, see [Administering AD LDS Directory Partitions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272302).
