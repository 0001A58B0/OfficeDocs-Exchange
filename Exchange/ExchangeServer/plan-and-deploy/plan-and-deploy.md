### Establish a test environment
<a name="Test"> </a>

Before installing Exchange 2016 for the first time, we recommend that you install it in an isolated test environment. This approach reduces the risk of end-user downtime and negative ramifications to the production environment.

The test environment will act as your "proof of concept" for your new Exchange 2016 design and make it possible to move forward or roll back any implementations before deploying into your production environments. Having an exclusive test environment for validation and testing allows you to do pre-installation checks for your future production environments. By installing in a test environment first, we believe that your organization will have a better likelihood of success in a full production implementation.

For many organizations, the costs of building a test lab may be high because of the need to duplicate the production environment. To reduce the hardware costs associated with a prototype lab, we recommend the use of virtualization by using Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V technologies. Hyper-V enables server virtualization, allowing multiple virtual operating systems to run on a single physical machine.

For more detailed information about Hyper-V, see [Server Virtualization](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=117704). For information about Microsoft support of Exchange 2016 in production on hardware virtualization software, see "Hardware virtualization" in [Exchange 2016 system requirements](system-requirements.md).

## Deploying Exchange 2016

## Understanding Exchange 2016 Setup
<a name="Understand"> </a>

You can use different types and modes of Exchange 2016 Setup to install and maintain the various editions and versions of Exchange 2016.

### Exchange editions and versions

Exchange 2016 is available in two server editions: Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition. These are licensing editions that are defined by a product key. For more information, see [Exchange Server Licensing](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=237292).

### Types of Exchange Setup

You have the following options for Exchange 2016 Setup:

- **Exchange Setup UI**: Running Setup.exe without any command-line switches provides an interactive experience where you're guided by the Exchange 2016 Setup wizard.

- **Exchange Unattended Setup**: Running Setup.exe with command-line switches enables you to install Exchange from an interactive command line or through a script.

### Modes of Exchange Setup
<a name="Modes"> </a>

Setup for Exchange 2016 includes several installation modes:

- **Install**: Use this mode when you're installing a new server role or adding a server role to an existing installation (maintenance mode). You can use this mode from both the Exchange Setup wizard and the unattended install.

- **Uninstall**: Use this mode when you're removing the Exchange installation from a computer. You can use this mode from both the Exchange Setup wizard and the unattended install.

- **Upgrade**: Select this mode used when you have an existing installation of Exchange and you're installing a cumulative update or service pack. You can use this mode from both the Exchange Setup wizard and the unattended install.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Exchange 2016 doesn't support in-place upgrades from previous versions of Exchange. This mode is used only to install cumulative updates or service packs.

- **RecoverServer**: Use this mode when there has been a catastrophic failure of a server, and you need to recover data. You must install a server using the same fully qualified domain name (FQDN) as the failed server, and then run Setup with the **/m:RecoverServer** switch. Don't specify the roles to restore. Setup detects the Exchange Server object in Active Directory and installs the corresponding files and configuration automatically. After you recover the server, you can restore databases and reconfigure any additional settings. To run in **RecoverServer** mode, you can't have Exchange installed on the server. The Exchange server object must exist in Active Directory. You can only use this mode during an unattended installation.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You must complete one mode of Setup before you can use another mode.
