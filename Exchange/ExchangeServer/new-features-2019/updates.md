# Updates for Exchange 2019

Exchange 2019 follows a quarterly delivery model to release Cumulative Updates (CUs) that address customer-reported issues and to possibly add new functionality and/or features. Critical product updates (packages that address a Microsoft-released security bulletin or contain a change in time zone definitions) are released as needed on a monthly basis for the most recently released CU and the preceeding CU.

Because each CU is a full installation of Exchange that includes updates and changes from all previous CU's, you don't need to install any previously released CU's when installing a new Exchange server using the latest released CU.

The following table contains links to Exchange Team blog posts ("What's New" information) for this and other Exchange 2019 CUs.

- To upgrade to the latest CU after you've downloaded it, see [Upgrade Exchange to the latest Cumulative Update](../plan-and-deploy/install-cumulative-updates.md).
