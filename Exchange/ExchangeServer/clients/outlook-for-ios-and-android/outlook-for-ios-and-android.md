# Outlook for iOS and Android

 **Summary**: These articles contain architectural and security information for administrators about Outlook for iOS and Android in an Exchange 2016 on-premises environment.
  
Outlook for iOS and Android supports two authentication types in Exchange on-premises environments: Basic authentication and hybrid Modern Authentication.
  
Outlook for iOS and Android uses Basic authentication with Exchange ActiveSync in the following environments:
  
- In Exchange Server 2010 environments
    
- When a hybrid relationship with Office 365 has not been configured
    
- When hybrid Modern Authentication has not been enabled
    
For more information see [Using Basic authentication with Outlook for iOS and Android](use-basic-auth.md).
  
For customers running Exchange Server 2013 or Exchange Server 2016 in a hybrid relationship with Office 365, Outlook for iOS and Android can be configured to leverage hybrid Modern Authentication. For more information, see [Using hybrid Modern Authentication with Outlook for iOS and Android](use-hybrid-modern-auth.md).
