# Updates for Exchange 2016

 **Summary**: Learn how the cumulative update process for Exchange 2016 works. This article also provides links to information about the features and improvements that were included in current, and previous, Exchange 2016 CU's.
  
Exchange 2016 follows a scheduled delivery model. In this model, cumulative updates (CU), which address customer-reported issues and may include new functionality and/or features, are released quarterly. Critical product updates, which are packages that address a Microsoft-released security bulletin or contain a change in time zone definitions, are released as needed on a monthly basis for the most recently released CU and the immediately previous CU.
  
To get the latest version of Exchange 2016, download and install [Cumulative Update 10 for Exchange Server 2016](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2002912). Because each CU is a full installation of Exchange and includes updates and changes from all previous CU's, you don't need to install any previous CU's or Exchange 2016 RTM first.
  
The following table contains links to Exchange Team blog posts ("What's New" information) for this and other Exchange 2016 CUs.
  
- For information on how to upgrade to the latest CU after you've downloaded it, see [Upgrade Exchange 2016 to the latest cumulative update](../plan-and-deploy/install-cumulative-updates.md).
    
- For information about the new features you'll get when you upgrade to Exchange 2016 from previous versions of Exchange, see [What's new in Exchange 2016](new-features.md).
    
- For downloads and updates for other versions of Exchange, see [Exchange Server Updates: build numbers and release dates](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=512549).
