# Learn more about room mailboxes

A room mailbox is a resource mailbox that's assigned to a physical location, such as a conference room, an auditorium, or a training room. After an admin creates room mailboxes, users can easily reserve rooms by including room mailboxes in meeting requests. For more information about room mailboxes, check out  [Create and manage room mailboxes](create-and-manage-room-mailboxes.md).
