# Exchange 2016 Setup - Add Server Role

On the **Add Server Role** page, you can add a server role to an existing Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 deployment.
  
    
    

To add a server role, select the check box next to the server role you want to install. If a server role is installed, its check box will be selected and **[Installed]** will appear next to it.
When you add a role, you can select **Automatically install Windows Server roles and features that are required to install Exchange Server** to have the Setup wizard install required Windows prerequisites. You may need to reboot the computer to complete the installation of some Windows features. If you don't select this option, you must install the Windows features manually.
  
    
    


> [!NOTE]
> This option installs only the Windows features required by Exchange. You must install other prerequisites manually. For more information, see  [Exchange 2016 prerequisites](exchange-2016-prerequisites.md). 
  
    
    

The **Management Tools** option is selected automatically if the **Mailbox role** option is selected. You can't clear the **Management Tools** option if the **Mailbox role** is selected.For more information about deploying Exchange 2016, see  [Planning and deployment](planning-and-deployment.md).For more information about Exchange server roles, see  [Exchange 2016 Architecture](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/0dac9f83-efd2-4a2d-940a-c03310bf9c6a.aspx).Having problems?
