# Learn more about retention tags

Retention tags and retention policies help you manage email lifecycle. They specify when a mailbox item should be deleted or moved to the archive mailbox. You can also use a retention tag to never move or delete an item. Retention tags are grouped in a retention policy and the retention policy is applied to mailboxes.
  
    
    

You can create the following type of retention tags: 
- **Default policy tags (DPTs)** These are default retention tags for the entire mailbox.
    
  
- **Retention policy tags (RPTs)** These are for default folders. The only valid action is to delete or delete permanently.
    
  
- **Personal tags** These tags become available in Outlook and Outlook Web App. Users can use them to apply to a mailbox folder or an individual item.
