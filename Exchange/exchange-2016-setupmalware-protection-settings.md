# Exchange 2016 Setup - Malware Protection Settings

On the **Malware Protection Settings** page, you can choose whether you want to enable or disable malware scanning. Malware scanning helps protect your organization from viruses and spyware.
  
    
    

 Malware scanning is enabled by default. You might want to disable malware scanning if you're using another product for malware scanning or if this server can't access the Internet. Malware scanning requires an Internet connection to download anti-malware engine and definition updates.
If you want to disable malware scanning on this server, select **No**. Otherwise, select **Yes** to keep malware scanning enabled on this server. We recommend that you leave malware scanning enabled.
  
    
    


> [!NOTE]
>  We recommend that you download engine and definition updates on this server prior to placing this server in production. Do the following:>  Open the Exchange Management Shell.>  Change to the C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Scripts directory.>  Run the following command.>  To download updates, this computer must be able to access the Internet and be able to establish a connection on TCP port 80.
