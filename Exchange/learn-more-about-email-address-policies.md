# Learn more about email address policies

By default, Exchange contains an email address policy for every mail-enabled user. This default policy specifies the recipient's alias as the local part of the email address and uses the default accepted domain. The local part of an email address is the name that appears before the at sign (@). However, you can change how your recipients' email addresses will display. For example, you can specify that the addresses display as  _firstname_. _lastname_@contoso.com.
