# Learn more about accounts and credentials in a hybrid deployment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature of Exchange 2016 isn't fully compatible with Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China and some feature limitations may apply. For more information, see  [Learn about Office 365 operated by 21Vianet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=313640). 
  
    
    

On the **Credentials** pages, you need to enter the credentials for both an on-premises Microsoft Exchange and Office 365 tenant account. These accounts are used to allow the Hybrid Configuration wizard to configure the features of the hybrid deployment of your on-premises and Exchange Online organizations.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both the on-premises and Office 365 tenant accounts must be members of the Organization Management management role group in their organizations for the hybrid deployment features to be correctly configured by the Hybrid Configuration wizard. For organizations using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) with their hybrid deployment, you'll still need to use the Office 365 tenant account and credentials when prompted for Office 365 tenant account information.
