# Exchange 2016 Setup - Check for Updates

On the **Check for Updates** page, you can choose whether you want Setup to connect to the Internet and download product and security updates for Microsoft Exchange Server 2016.
  
    
    

If you select **Connect to the Internet and check for updates**, Setup will download updates and apply them before it continues. Updates may include the following:
- Language pack updates
    
  
- Exchange roll-ups
    
  
- Security fixes for Exchange
    
  
If updates are found, Setup will download and install them. After the updates are installed, Setup will restart.If you select **Don't check for updates right now**, you can download and install updates manually later. We recommend that you download and install updates now. Having problems? Ask for help in the Exchange forums.
