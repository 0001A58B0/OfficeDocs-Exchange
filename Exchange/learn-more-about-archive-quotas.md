# Learn more about archive quotas

Items stored in the archive mailbox don't count toward the user's mailbox storage quota. An archive mailbox has its own archive quota and archive warning quota. In Exchange 2013, the default archive quota is 50 GB and archive warning quota is 45 GB. In Exchange Online, archive quotas depend on the subscription plan.
