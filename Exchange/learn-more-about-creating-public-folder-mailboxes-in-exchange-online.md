# Learn more about creating public folder mailboxes in Exchange Online

If you don't already have public folders in your Exchange Online organization, you can create the first public folder mailbox. The first public folder mailbox that you create is known as the primary public folder mailbox, and it contains the only writable copy of the public folder hierarchy. After the primary public folder mailbox is created, you can create public folders. As the content of the public folders increases beyond the capacity of the public folder mailbox quotas, Microsoft automatically creates new public folder mailboxes to accommodate the size of your public folders.
