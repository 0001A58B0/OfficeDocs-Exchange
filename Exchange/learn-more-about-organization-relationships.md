Organization relationships allow you to enable federated sharing with another federated Exchange organization for the purpose of sharing calendar free/busy information between users in both organizations. Requiring a federation trust with the Microsoft Federation Gateway, organization relationships are one-to-one relationships between two Exchange organizations, not a relationship between individual users in the Exchange organizations.
