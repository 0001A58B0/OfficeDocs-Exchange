# Learn more about shared mailboxes

A shared mailbox is a mailbox that multiple users can use to read and send email messages. Shared mailboxes can also be used to provide a common calendar, allowing multiple users to schedule and view vacation time or work shifts.
  
    
    

 **Why set up a shared mailbox?**
- Provides a generic email address (for example, info@contoso.com or sales@contoso.com), that customers can use to inquire about your company.
    
  
- Allows departments that provide centralized services to employees (for example, help desk, human resources, or printing services), to respond to employee questions.
    
  
- Allows multiple users to monitor and reply to email sent to an email address (for example, an address used specifically by the help desk).
