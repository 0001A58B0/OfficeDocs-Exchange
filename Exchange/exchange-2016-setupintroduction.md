# Exchange 2016 Setup - Introduction

Use the Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 Setup wizard to install Exchange 2016 on a computer. If you want to remove Exchange, you must use **Control Panel\\Programs and Features**. 
  
    
    

Before you complete this wizard, be aware of the following:
- You should read the  [Release notes for Exchange 2016](release-notes-for-exchange-2016.md).
    
  
- You must satisfy the  [Exchange 2016 system requirements](exchange-2016-system-requirements.md) and [Exchange 2016 prerequisites](exchange-2016-prerequisites.md).
    
  
- You can't install the Mailbox and Edge Transport server roles on the same computer.
    
  
- You must ensure the account you use is delegated membership in the Schema Admins group if you haven't previously prepared the Active Directory schema. If you're installing the first Exchange 2016 server in the organization, the account you use must have membership in the Enterprise Admins group. If you've already prepared the schema and aren't installing the first Exchange 2016 server in the organization, the account you use must be a member of the Exchange 2016 Organization Management role group.
    
  
After Setup has finished installing Exchange, you need to finalize your deployment. For more information, see  [Exchange 2016 post-installation tasks](exchange-2016-post-installation-tasks.md).
