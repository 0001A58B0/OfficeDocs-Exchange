# Learn more about creating an In-Place Hold and eDiscovery search

You can create an In-Place eDiscovery search or an In-Place Hold to search and preserve content in Exchange mailboxes. After you create an In-Place eDiscovery search, you can start or stop the search, get an estimate of items returned in the search (including statistics for keywords used in the query), preview search results, and copy returned items to a Discovery mailbox. You can also export returned items to a PST file.
  
    
    

You can use the same search used for eDiscovery to also place items returned on In-Place Hold. Items can be held indefinitely, or you can specify the duration.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you specify the duration for an In-Place Hold, it is calculated from the date the item was received or created in the mailbox. 
  
    
    

When you create an eDiscovery search, you can choose to search of all mailboxes in an organization by selecting **Search all mailboxes** on the **Mailboxes** page of **New in-place discovery &amp; hold**. In Exchange Online, you can search a maximum of 10,000 mailboxes in a single eDiscovery search. In Exchange Server 2013, the maximum is 5,000 mailboxes. If you're creating an In-Place Hold, you must select **Specify mailboxes to search**. If you select **Search all mailboxes**, the **Place content matching the search query in selected mailboxes on hold** option will be unavailable on the **In-Place Hold settings** page.
