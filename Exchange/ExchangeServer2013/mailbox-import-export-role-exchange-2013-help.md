## Enabling or disabling role assignments

By enabling or disabling a role assignment, you control whether that role assignment should be in effect. If a role assignment is disabled, the permissions granted by the associated role aren't applied to the role assignee. This is convenient if you want to temporarily remove permissions without deleting a role assignment. For more information, see [Change a role assignment](change-a-role-assignment-exchange-2013-help.md).
