# Learn more about equipment mailboxes

An equipment mailbox is a resource mailbox assigned to a resource that's not location specific, such as a laptop, projector, or a company car. After an admin creates an equipment mailbox, users can easily reserve the piece of equipment by including the corresponding equipment mailbox in a meeting request. For more information about equipment mailboxes, check out  [Manage equipment mailboxes](manage-equipment-mailboxes.md).
