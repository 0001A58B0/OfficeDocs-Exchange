The Hybrid Configuration wizard is an automated tool that streamlines configuring a hybrid deployment between your on-premises Microsoft Exchange organization and an Exchange Online organization.
After verifying that your organization meets the prerequisites for configuring a hybrid deployment, use the Hybrid Deployment wizard to configure:
  
    
    


- The domains you want to enable for hybrid features, such as calendar free/busy sharing, MailTips, and message tracking.
    
  
- How mail should flow between your on-premises and Exchange Online organizations.
    
  
- The certificate that you should use to authenticate secure mail transport between your on-premises and Exchange Online organizations.
    
  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are several important network and configuration considerations and prerequisites that you need to complete before you use the Hybrid Configuration wizard. You must meet the requirements for hybrid deployments outlined in  [Hybrid Deployment Prerequisites](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/e7454db0-fed4-4662-8890-9501126b1ba2.aspx). Then, you'll be ready to use the Hybrid Configuration wizard to configure your Exchange organization for the hybrid deployment.
